Code Test

Day 1- 

Decided to stick with a tableview to list the books. Thought a collectionView would not display the title and author of the books as well as a table view. Was able to layout with constraints the main page of the app and get the data displayed on the tableView from the API. App was crashing when I was running it but it was due to a faulty label outlet. 

Added a search bar feature that will update the book list based on what you are typing in. This is seaching against the title.

Bugs to go back and fix:
    Keyboard wont toggle off on seach feature - resignFirstResponder?

Things to improve:
    Need to create graphics and impove the overall look of the app (waiting until all coding is done)

    When typing in the search bar can I have it search by title and author?

Day 2-

Built out the Add Book page and the Details Page. Decided to give the user the ability to checkout out a book from the Details page as well as edit the books information. Most of the logic is built out with the exception of the API calls which I will tackle tomorrow. Only ran into some minor issues but they where quickly sorted out when I realized my mistakes with my logic. 

Bugs to go back and fix:
  All the coding seems to work as it should (for now).

Things to improve:
  Would like to add feature where the user can also return a book but that would require changes to the API.
